<ul>
<li>What I’m going to be talking about here is the why and how of personal, individual practice. Because much like learning a language, a trade, magick, a skill, meditation or anything else worth its salt, it is always something that has to be practiced, in that manner one has to be constantly (or as much as possible) practicing the worldview</li>
<li>changing your perspective are all processes and anything process based generally needs to be practiced</li>
<li>What are they doing that I couldn’t have done myself?</li>
<li>Archaic Torso of Apollo – Rainer Maria Rilke</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>for here there is no place<br />
  that does not see you. You must change your life.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>You must change your life is most likely your worst nightmare. And it is easier to change literally anything else, than change your self.</li>
<li>Do things with yourself, your body, experience life, even in the most minor, inconsequential ways – not because you wish to be watched, recorded or envied, but because experience is at the heart of existence, and personal experience can neither be sold, bought or commodified.</li>
<li>Exit is critique</li>
<li>meaning which works in relation to a whole host of other meanings you have placed onto other things within your world</li>
<li>Man’s idea of play and enjoyment has been replaced with escapist hedonism</li>
<li>We believe that Progress is good in all cases</li>
<li>Standardized time, the destroyer of spontaneity</li>
<li>Stop assuming comfort and niceness is your endgame</li>
<li>We were taught by TV shows, video games, fantasy novels, the education system and society that things just happen. The hero happens to turn up, the villain is always planning something, politics is a series of (always) big events, books promoting the chosen one, history taught as linear progression of happenings and friends and family discussing gossip, rumours and events of their lives. This entire dynamic pushes the idea that things just happen, all the time, everywhere, everyone is having things happen to them. It pushes the idea that change isn’t a very slow – often quite dull – process, but is a series of bangs.</li>
<li>Identity, as it is commonly understood these days is merely a culmination of one’s consumption habits. ‘</li>
<li>Thought has become caught between possessions and standardization.</li>
<li>If you are to remove all the vices from most people’s lives what do you have left? A shallow…entity.</li>
<li>What the Neo-Ascetic does is become mindful, especially in relation to habits of desire.</li>
<li>Everything is related to one’s path in life, and how you deal with the most simply dilemmas is how you shall deal with the big ones; how you do one thing is how you do all things.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the sake of its own efficiency and security, the System needs to bring about deep and radical social changes to match the changed conditions resulting from technological progress.<br />
   The frustration of life under the circumstances imposed by the System leads to rebellious impulses.<br />
   Rebellious impulses are co-opted by the System in the service of the social changes it requires; activists “rebel” against the old and outmoded values that are no longer of use to the System and in favor of the new values that the System needs us to accept.<br />
   In this way rebellious impulses, which otherwise might have been dangerous to the System, are given an outlet that is not only harmless to the System, but useful to it. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Much of the public resentment resulting from the imposition of social changes is drawn away from the System and its institutions and is directed instead at the radicals who spearhead the social changes. </li>
<li>Nothing makes modern Western man feel freer than chatting about the chains he shares with others.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress. ”<br />
  (Paul Virilio, Politics of the Very Worst)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>There’s a little fascist inside all of us and we fucking love them, why? Everything is easier when you’re told what to do.</li>
<li>the idea that there is state of freedom fit just for you that is external to you is false.</li>
<li>We are free is a paradox.</li>
<li>Unlike reading, learning, meditating, practicing or concentrating, contemporary acts of entertainment require nothing from the viewer, apart from one thing, that they stare in a certain direction. They are mediums of apathy.</li>
<li>interject a question without attending to the answer is a tyranny</li>
<li>one can just be happy, right now, this instant, is a complete miscommunication of what happiness is</li>
<li>prior to the happiness a certain amount of suffering took place, more than likely an amount in relation to the happiness you felt.</li>
<li>The destruction of the present is found within the language of those who desire only production and consumption.</li>
<li>the large majority of our consumption is really a subconscious effort to escape the uncomfortable truth of the present.</li>
<li>Can you not deal with yourself, not even for a minute!</li>
<li>totalitarian normality</li>
<li>You can become freer, but how you then utilize that freedom is still up to you…that’s what it is to be free</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Freedom is a two-edged sword of which one edge is liberty and the other, responsibility. Both edges are exceedingly sharp and the weapon is not suited to casual, cowardly or treacherous hands.” – Jack Parsons</p>
