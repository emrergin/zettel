2inci **hakem raporu**m. 18 Ocakta teslim etmem lazım.

### Summary
One way to evade the Arrow's Impossibility Theorem would be to eliminate to possibility of having irrelevant alternatives by decreasing the number of alternatives to two. In that domain, any group decision function can be understood as a binary aggregation in which each agent picks one of the alternatives or is indecisive between them.

The paper is mainly interested in extending social choice rules onto the domain of higher order societies which are defined as societies of societies. Each decision unit may either be an individual or a collection of individuals or for higher orders, collections of collections.

It mentions a hierarchy of democracies, which is different than a direct democracy. In the same time, aggregative part of the democracy is emphasized at the expense of deliberative side of it.

Bartholdi et al (2019). They discuss equitable voting rule: it is possible to permute the preferences of two
voters and still keeping unchanged the election result at any voting profile.

Assumptions:
- the same individual voter is allowed to be a member of different societies in the hierarchy.
- an individual voter votes the same way in every society she is a member of. 
- the councils may be very complex.

Reducibility of a social welfare function: $f$ is reducible to $g$ if one gets always the same results if $f$ is applied to a first-order society or $g$ is applied to a higher-order one iteratively. 
More technically, each society $S$, there exists $\sigma_S$ with $B(\sigma_S)\subseteq B(S)$ such that, $f(P_S)=g(P_{\sigma_S})$.
Reducibility of a social welfare function: $f$ is reducible to $g$ such that, one always the same results if $f$ is applied to a first-order society or $g$ is applied iteratively to a higher-order one that does not introduce any new agents.

1. All social choice functions that is reducible to simple majority rule or the consensus rule.
2. Comparison of the general social choice functions with social choice function with two voters.

Main Theorems of the paper consists of:
1. The simple majority rule is reducible to the consensus rule.
2. A social choice function is reducible to the consensus rule if and only if it satisfies Monotonicity, [[Neutrality]], Strong Pareto. #linklenebilir 

### Assessment

### Major recommendations
- Page 2: The author discusses "equitable voting rule, where any voter could play the role of another voter, i.e. it is possible to permute the preferences of two voters and still keeping unchanged the election result at any voting profile"
	- The defined equity here is n-equity and is equivalent to symmetry. The text should be made clear on how the concept of equity and symmetry differs to further the point.
- Social welfare functions can mean many things. The use here is more akin to social choice functions, and the discussion will benefit from changing the term. It feels especially misleading to call a binary aggregation a social welfare function.
- Anonymity fails for Majority in some higher order examples, because some agents are simply part of more societies. This is akin to having members with higher weights in the baseline model with only first order societies.

### Minor recommendations
- p16. References Bartholdi et al (2019) should be updated. 
- p.5 A first-order society is a (possibly empty) subset of S, should be G.
- p. 8 (Here I did not use superscripts, because f and g can have different arities) would do better in a footnote.
- p.10 Last paragraph. "Remind" should be "remember"

### Important Articles

- [[@murakami1966formal]] - Murakami (1966; 1968)
- [[The Theory of Representative Majority Decision]]- Fishburn (1971)
- [[@may1952set]]
- Bartholdi also names the rule as voting rules.
#### Confusing points
- p. 6 what is the point of minimum and maximum rule here exactly?
- Neutrality for 2 alternatives

#### Kendime notlar
Alt seviyelerin oylarının çoğunluk ile bir üst oylamaya dahil edildiği, sonrasında, bir sonraki seçimde de benzer mantığın işlediği seçimler. Hiyerarşik demokrasiler yahut genelleştirilmiş temsili demokrasiler.
