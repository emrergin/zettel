### Alternatives as Candidates
- We live in the world of social choice functions
- The input is our order on alternatives and the output is an alternative
- The comparison is already given in the personal rankings
- The utilities represent the underlying rankings

### Rankings as Candidates
- So the system is trying to pick a ranking.
- This might be interpreted the outcome is... one of us
- It is either a hypothetical collective rationality or an actual leader
- This understanding is encapsulated by the concept of social welfare functions

### Comparison Between Rankings
- Given a ranking, how do we compare other rankings using the prior one?
- One might try to construct a metaranking that orders rankings instead of the alternatives.
- Note that any such solution will need an extension of the underlying ranking of the agent.
